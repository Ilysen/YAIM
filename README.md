# Big giant TODO

* Include Unity and font files in repo (check attribution for font)
* Save/load
* Drop All functionality (should probably hold to do)

# Yet Another Inventory Mod

Yet Another Inventory Mod, or YAIM (pronounced "yam" for sillies) is a modern backpack mod for My Summer Car. For more info, take a look at the Nexus page (tbd).

YAIM is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html), which can be found in full in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

## Attributions

* The audio files used for opening and closing the inventory are graciously sourced from FilmCow's Royalty Free Sound Effects Library on [https://filmcow.itch.io/filmcow-sfx](itch.io).
* This mod borrows segments of code from [https://github.com/wampa842/mysummermods](Carry More (backpack)), by Wampa842 ([GPL v3 license](https://github.com/Wampa842/MySummerMods/blob/master/COPYING.TXT)). The original mod is abandoned; this one is intended to serve as a spiritual successor, and it wouldn't exist without the foundation that they built here. Thank you very much!

## Changelog
