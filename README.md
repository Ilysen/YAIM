# Yet Another Inventory Mod

Yet Another Inventory Mod, or YAIM (pronounced "yam" for sillies) is a modern backpack mod for My Summer Car. For more info, take a look at the Nexus page (tbd).

## Attributions

* The audio files used for opening and closing the inventory are graciously sourced from FilmCow's Royalty Free Sound Effects Library on [itch.io](https://filmcow.itch.io/filmcow-sfx).
* This mod borrows segments of code from [Carry More (backpack)](https://github.com/wampa842/mysummermods), by Wampa842 ([GPL v3 license](https://github.com/Wampa842/MySummerMods/blob/master/COPYING.TXT)). The original mod is abandoned; this one is intended to serve as a spiritual successor, and it wouldn't exist without the foundation that they built here. Thank you very much!

## Where's the Unity project files?

Due to some chicanery and lost files on my end, I haven't uploaded the Unity prefab (used for creating the actual GUI element) here. It'll come at a later date, though, don't worry!
